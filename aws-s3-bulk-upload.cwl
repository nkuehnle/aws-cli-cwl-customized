  This is a CWL workflow (with Arvados specific enhancements) to
  perform bulk upload of a list of files to a S3 bucket.

  It spreads the load across the desired number of parallel downloads by
  splitting up the list and giving each compute node a list of files to
  download.

  Note: it divides the list ahead of time by round-robin assigning each
  entry in `files` to a batch, so if there is a big disparity in object
  sizes, some jobs might finish before the others.

  This workflow has no output besides success or failure status.

      so you usually want a trailing slash.
